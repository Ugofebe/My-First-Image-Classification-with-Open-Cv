# OpenCV Image Classification Project

This project focuses on image classification using OpenCV for image processing and sklearn for machine learning model building. It employs Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classification algorithm.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images into different categories using machine learning techniques. OpenCV is utilized for image preprocessing tasks such as resizing, grayscale conversion, and feature extraction. Then, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained on the extracted features for classification.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV (cv2)
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   
## Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data Preparation:
Prepare your image dataset and organize it into appropriate folders based on categories.
## Data Preprocessing:
Use OpenCV for image preprocessing tasks such as resizing, converting to grayscale, and extracting features.
## Model Training:
Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on the preprocessed image data.
## Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## Inference:
Use the trained model to classify new images into the specified categories.
